<p>
	Studying brain function is as equally important as understanding the structures that
	make these computations possible. Using advanced MRI techniques like
	diffusion-weighted (DWI) and quantitative imaging (qMRI), we study how developmental
	and individual differences in the cortex and connections of the brain underlie
	changes and variability in behavioral skills like reading and recognizing. We also
	seek to understand the source of these in vivo measures using immunohistochemistry to
	image fine-scale structures like proteins and lipids, and quantify their change
	across development.

## The origins of organization:

<p>
	While we have made much progress in mapping out the topographical organization of
	function across the human brain, the origins of this organization are still a bit of
	a mystery. We approach this problem from two scales, a broad scale using MRI to
	measure how unique experience or stimuli can change brain organization, and a finer
	scale using gene transcription and cytoarchitecture to see how anatomy governs and
	constrains a region's inputs and computations.

## Mission

<div>
	The human brain undergoes dramatic changes in the time between birth and adulthood.
	In fact, the human brain shows the most protracted development of any species, making
	it uniquely sensitive to environmental influence and our experiences. From MRI to
	microscopy, we employ a range of techniques to study the nature of this development,
	and more importantly, what happens when this development goes awry. In addition to
	conducting experiments, the lab is a teaching environment committed to training
	students and scientists from all backgrounds. A diversity of minds leads to a
	diversity of discoveries. Below are some areas of research on which the lab
	currently focuses. If you're interested in participating in an experiment, please get
	in touch!

## Experience and the brain:

<div>
	To what extent does experience sculpt the function and topography of human cortex?
	Through magnetic resonance imaging, we seek to create models relating experience
	across development with the emergence of structural and functional organization in
	the brain. Importantly, we can being to understand what happens when this development
	is disrupted through either atypical childhood experiences or disorders. 
</div>

## The role of tissue:

<div>
	Studying brain function is as equally important as understanding the structures that
	make these computations possible. Using advanced MRI techniques like
	diffusion-weighted (DWI) and quantitative imaging (qMRI), we study how developmental
	and individual differences in the cortex and connections of the brain underlie
	changes and variability in behavioral skills like reading and recognizing. We also
	seek to understand the source of these in vivo measures using immunohistochemistry to
	image fine-scale structures like proteins and lipids, and quantify their change
	across development.
</div>

## The origins of organization:

<div>
	While we have made much progress in mapping out the topographical organization of
	function across the human brain, the origins of this organization are still a bit of
	a mystery. We approach this problem from two scales, a broad scale using MRI to
	measure how unique experience or stimuli can change brain organization, and a finer
	scale using gene transcription and cytoarchitecture to see how anatomy governs and
	constrains a region's inputs and computations.

	How many times were you frustrated while looking
	out for a good collection of programming/algorithm
	/interview questions? What did you expect and what
	did you get? This portal has been created to
	provide well written, well thought and well
	explained solutions for selected questions.
	An IIT Roorkee alumnus and founder of GeeksforGeeks.
	He loves to solve programming problems in most
	efficient ways. Apart from GeeksforGeeks, he has
	worked with DE Shaw and Co. as a software developer
	and JIIT Noida as an assistant professor. It is a
	good platform to learn programming. It is an
	educational website. Prepare for the Recruitment
	drive of product based companies like Microsoft,

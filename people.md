		<p>
		<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
		Omar Singleton is a PhD student at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. He previously worked on neuroimaging projects at
		MGH, and now studies how the human thalamus develops across the lifespan and the roles
		it plays in mediating developmental changes in the cortex in neurotypical individuals 
		and those diagnosed with psychiatric disorders.

		<p>
			<b>Lab Manager</b><br>
    		Anna is a research specialist at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute where she is the lab manager of the Brain Development Lab. Currently, her research focuses on characterizing patterns of cortical pleating in the human dorsal visual stream, as well as examining the corresponding neural and behavioral development of visuospatial attention.

		<h2>Edan Daniel</h2>
		<img class="headshot" src="/assets/img/edan.jpg" alt="photo of edan daniel" width="200" height="200"/>
		<p>
		<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
		Edan is a PhD student at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute. She previously worked on EEG analyses in the Dinstein
		Lab at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, and now researches how visual experience
		during either childhood or adulthood shapes the organization and computations 
		that occur within visual cortex.

		<h2>Patricia Hoyos</h2>
		<img class="headshot" src="/assets/img/patricia.jpg" alt="photo of patricia hoyos" width="200" height="200"/>
		<p>
		<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
    	Patricia Hoyos is a PhD candidate at the Princeton Neuroscience Institute, and member of the Gomez and Kastner labs. She is currently studying the development of the human dorsal stream to understand how changes in our attentional abilities and biases are shaped by structural and computational changes occurring within visual cortex. Patricia is also an HHMI Gilliam Fellow and Presidential Fellow.

	</div>
	<p>
	<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
	Frederick is a Presidential Fellow and PhD candidate in the neuroscience department at Princeton University. His research focuses on large scale brain networks and cerebellar contributions to cortical structure and function across the lifespan, and is supported by the National Science Foundation and National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.

	<p>
		<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
		Edan is a PhD student in PNI. She previously worked on EEG analyses in the Dinstein
		Lab at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, and now researches how visual experience
		during either childhood or adulthood shapes the organization and computations 
		that occur within visual cortex.

</div>
<p>
	<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
	Omar Singleton is a PhD student in PNI. He previously worked on neuroimaging projects at
	MGH, and now studies how the human thalamus develops across the lifespan and the roles
	it plays in mediating developmental changes in the cortex in neurotypical individuals 
	and those diagnosed with psychiatric disorders.

</div>
<p>
	<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
	Patricia Hoyos is a PhD student in PNI, and member of the Gomez and Kastner labs. She
	is currently studying the development of the human dorsal stream to understand how 
	changes in our attentional abilities and biases are shaped by structural and 
	computational changes occurring within visual cortex.

<p>
	<b>Graduate Student</b><br>
	Damola completed her undergraduate degree in neuroscience  at the University of 
	Pennsylvania. She is a first-year student in PNI rotating in the lab where she'll be
	studying auditory cortex development through novel MRI methods.

<p>
	<b>Undergraduate Student</b><br> 
	I am an undergraduate senior majoring in neuroscience with a minor in computer 
	science. I am interested in identifying biomarkers that could enhance the diagnosis 
	or treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders using imaging techniques. At the Brain 
	Development Lab, I worked with Fred to investigate the cerebellum-neocortex 
	codevelopment in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. For my ongoing senior 
	thesis, I am continuing the investigation of cerebellar-neocortical pathways, 
	focusing on their potential contribution to object recognition. During my free time, 
	I love coloring, doing yoga, and spending time with friends and family.

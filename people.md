<p>
	Graduate Student<br>
	Fred is a PhD student, Presidential Fellow, and Ford Fellow within PNI. He is a 
	member of the Gomez and Wang labs. His research focuses on large scale human brain 
	networks and cerebellar contributions to cortical structure and function across 
	development and the lifespan.

<p>
	Graduate Student<br>
	Edan is a PhD student in PNI. She previously worked on EEG analyses in the Dinstein
	Lab at Ben-Gurion University in Israel, and now researches how visual experience
	during either childhood or adulthood shapes the organization and computations 
	that occur within visual cortex.

<p>
	Graduate Student<br>
	Omar Single is a PhD student in PNI. He previously worked on neuroimaging projects at
	MGH, and now studies how the human thalamus develops across the lifespan and the roles
	it plays in mediating developmental changes in the cortex in neurotypical individuals 
	and those diagnosed with psychiatric disorders.

<p>
	Graduate Student<br>
	Patricia Hoyos is a PhD student in PNI, and member of the Gomez and Kastner labs. She
	is currently studying the development of the human dorsal stream to understand how 
	changes in our attentional abilities and biases are shaped by structural and 
	computational changes occurring within visual cortex.

## Mission

 <div class="row">
  <div class="column" markdown="1">
  The human brain undergoes dramatic changes in the time between birth and adulthood. In fact, the human brain shows the most protracted development of any species, making it uniquely sensitive to environmental influence and our experiences. From MRI to microscopy, we employ a range of techniques to study the nature of this development, and more importantly, what happens when this development goes awry. In addition to conducting experiments, the lab is a teaching environment committed to training students and scientists from all backgrounds. A diversity of minds leads to a diversity of discoveries. Below are some areas of research on which the lab currently focuses. If you're interested in participating in an experiment, please get in touch!

  To what extent does experience sculpt the function and topography of human cortex?
  Through magnetic resonance imaging, we seek to create models relating experience across
  development with the emergence of structural and functional organization in the brain.
  Importantly, we can being to understand what happens when this development goes awry.
